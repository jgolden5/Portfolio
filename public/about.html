    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Jonathan Gurr, an aspiring software engineer seeking an entry-level Java role, ideally in a Linux environment. Over the past two years, I've built a full-featured text editor and various scripts during my internship. I'm currently looking to learn from software engineers at all stagesâ€”whether they're seasoned pros or starting their first internship. I want to understand how they got where they are and hear directly from those doing the work I hope to do.</p>
