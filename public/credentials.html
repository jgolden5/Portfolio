        <td class="single-line-table">Quick learner</td>
        <td>At my internship, I had to learn several new technologies that were previously completely foreign to me in order to solve some problem. I developed an app to help me with this.</td>
        <td>This HIGHLY increased my learning effiency and doubled as an amazing way to take notes. I'm a person who finds a way to learn quickly.</td>
        <td>I'm sure I can develop ways to improve the learning efficiency of not only myself, but other coworkers at the company, and increase learning effectiveness and growth significantly at your company</td>

        <td class="single-line-table">Clear communicator</td>

        <td>Everyone in the kitchen always had an idea of how long the meat would take, which improves kitchen efficiency by 20%</td>
        <td>Clear communication on where I'm at with my portion of a project is highly beneficial to other members of the team who rely on such critical information.</td>
