        <td>As a result, I was able to consistently work 32 hours a week for the course of 96 weeks, for a total of 3,072 consistent work hours</td>
        <td>You can rest assured I will be working hard and getting stuff done when left on my own and will not require hand-holding or constant correction</td>

        <td>Quick and resourceful learner</td>
        <td>At my internship, I had to learn several new technologies that were previously completely foreign to me in order to solve some problem. I developed an app to help me with this.</td>
        <td>This HIGHLY increased my learning effiency and doubled as an amazing way to take notes. I'm a person who finds a way to learn quickly.</td>
        <td>I'm sure I can develop ways to improve the learning efficiency of not only myself, but other coworkers at the company, and increase learning effectiveness and growth significantly at your company</td>
