idea: Put my projects in a separate link, and separate them by "problem" and "solution," as was done with the first item on this portfolio site: https://www.onyedika.xyz/work (but do them for all projects on mine)
make main.html load the full correct format on MSYS2 system as well
plan a course (in README.md) for when I will make this website public (by paying for a domain name), identifying which domain name I would use and which website I would purchase it from (maybe make this part private somehow)
